## About The Project
This is the the project of Mechanical Practice. In this class, our team want to make a automated storage and retrieval system, we divide into two part:

* Website
Scanning QRcode on the goods, saving data in database and display on website.

* Motor Control
We make a thousandth model and use Raspberry Pi 3B+ to control all sansors and motors.

## Built With
### Website
* Django: High-level Python web framework
* Opencv: Scan QRcode
* Tkinter: Keyboard detect
* Ngrok: Open localhost
* MySQL: Database
* phpMyAdmin: Handle the administration of MySQL over the Web
* WebCam

### Motor Control
* Gpio pinout of Raspberry Pi
* Gpiozero: Control servo motor
* Multi-processing of Python
* Multi-threading of Python
* I2C
  
## Getting Started
### Configuration

#### Website
1. Done all the setup of Django.
2. Connect the website to the database.
3. Create a local server.
4. Open website

#### Motor Control
Configuratint every sensor & motor with wire„ÄÅdriver and circuit board. Then, using Gpio pinout of Raspberry Pi to control.

## Usage

### Website
We use webcam to scan QRcode which content is number on goods, we press a key to start to scan, then, data will store in database and display on website. On the website, we can check and manage all data.

### Motor Control
All action start with QRcode scan, after key press, the goods will arbitrarily assign to a empty storage area, location of goods can be checked on website. Above is done, the motor will start operate.
